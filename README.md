# Meeting-Cam

Organizations big or small have meetings and mostly these meetings are recorded for either reference sake for other usages such as detailed transcriptions. These recordings require the use of a professional camera operator and often individual microphones for all the speakers; such requirements are an unnecessary overhead and are often hard to meet. Imagine a scenario where a high level meeting is
ongoing and in that meeting discussion is taking place on confidential information, having a camera-man to record such meetings would be absurd or would perhaps require the company to hire people (camera crew) in house. Secrecy agreements with external organizations could be an option but again that is an overhead in terms of cost.  

Perhaps even a video conference could require a camera-man in case the meeting was between 1 to N or N to N clients. Our project aims to provide an automated system of recording such meetings thus removing the need for having a camera-man to be physically present in the room. Our solution will revolve around a device placed at the table that would be able to find the location of the sound and move the camera to point at that location.qwdassddsfvmdlmw
